Encapsulation: A way to place variables and methods into a singular section for easy controlled access to those variables and methods.
Pros: Can be used to control how much access the user gets
Cons: Longer code and slower execution

Inheritance: A way to allow the child class to have the same characteristics as parent class while also adding its' own unique additions.
Pros: No need to write a class which is very similar to the parent class, cuts code length
Cons: Multiple inheritance doesn't exist so the child class cannot have the characterisitcs of 2 or more classes

Polymorphism: A way to allow the same name do different functions using method overloading and method overriding.
Pros: Recycles tested code and saves time when writing.
Cons: Performance issues may occur runtime polymorphism, compile time polymorphism can be difficult to implement into code

Abstraction: A way to prevent trivial and unimportant sections of code from being shown to the user.
Pros: It reduces programming complexity and helps set up a framework for the code
Cons: Costs proccessing speed, can spread the effects and locations of bugs.
